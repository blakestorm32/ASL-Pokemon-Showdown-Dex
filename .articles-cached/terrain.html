<h1 id="terrain">Terrain</h1>
		<p>Terrain is a set of field effects that benefit grounded (?) Pokemon for 5 turns. Each of the four types of terrain has a move and Ability that start the effect. The moves are <a href="/moves/electricterrain" data-target="push">Electric Terrain</a>, <a href="/moves/grassyterrain" data-target="push">Grassy Terrain</a>, <a href="/moves/mistyterrain" data-target="push">Misty Terrain</a>, and <a href="/moves/psychicterrain" data-target="push">Psychic Terrain</a>, and the corresponding Abilities are <a href="/abilities/electricsurge" data-target="push">Electric Surge</a>, <a href="/abilities/grassysurge" data-target="push">Grassy Surge</a>, <a href="/abilities/mistysurge" data-target="push">Misty Surge</a>, and <a href="/abilities/psychicsurge" data-target="push">Psychic Surge</a>. When a different terrain effect comes into play, it replaces the old one. If the Pokemon that started the effect is holding a <a href="/items/terrainextender" data-target="push">Terrain Extender</a>, it lasts 8 turns instead.</p>
		<p>Some moves have altered behavior when used while any terrain is active, including <a href="/moves/camouflage" data-target="push">Camouflage</a>, <a href="/moves/naturepower" data-target="push">Nature Power</a>, and <a href="/moves/secretpower" data-target="push">Secret Power</a>. Certain Abilities are also activated while a specific terrain is in play, which include <a href="/abilities/grasspelt" data-target="push">Grass Pelt</a> during Grassy Terrain, and <a href="/abilities/surgesurfer" data-target="push">Surge Surfer</a> during Electric Terrain. There are four items that activate as soon as the holder is on the field at the same time as the corresponding terrain effect, which are <a href="/items/electricseed" data-target="push">Electric Seed</a>, <a href="/items/grassyseed" data-target="push">Grassy Seed</a>, <a href="/items/mistyseed" data-target="push">Misty Seed</a>, and <a href="/items/psychicseed" data-target="push">Psychic Seed</a>. The effects of all of these moves, Abilities, and items happen even if the Pokemon is not grounded.</p>
		<p>Pokemon that are in the invulnerable turn of a two-turn move are not considered grounded by terrain effects.</p>

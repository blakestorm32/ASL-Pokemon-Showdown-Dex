<h1 id="phazing">Phazing</h1>
		<p>Phazing moves are moves that make the opponent switch out, including <a href="/moves/whirlwind" data-target="push">Whirlwind</a>, <a href="/moves/roar" data-target="push">Roar</a>, <a href="/moves/dragontail" data-target="push">Dragon Tail</a>, and <a href="/moves/circlethrow" data-target="push">Circle Throw</a>. These moves always come with a high negative priority (currently -6) for balance reasons, due to the disruptive effect they would have if they were routinely capable of going first and denying the opponent access to any of their turns.</p>
		<p>The word "phaze" is short for "pseudo-Haze", since they're similar to <a href="/moves/haze" data-target="push">Haze</a> in that they reset stat boosts.</p>
		<p>Note that the Ability <a href="/abilities/suctioncups" data-target="push">Suction Cups</a> and the effect of <a href="/moves/ingrain" data-target="push">Ingrain</a> prevent phazing, though Pokemon with <a href="/abilities/moldbreaker" data-target="push">Mold Breaker</a>, <a href="/abilities/turboblaze" data-target="push">Turboblaze</a>, or <a href="/abilities/teravolt" data-target="push">Teravolt</a> can ignore the former.</p>

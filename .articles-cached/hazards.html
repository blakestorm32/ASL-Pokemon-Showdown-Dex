<h1 id="hazards">Hazards</h1>
		<p>Hazards are a set of moves that affect Pokemon as they switch into battle, including <a href="/moves/spikes" data-target="push">Spikes</a>, <a href="/moves/stealthrock" data-target="push">Stealth Rock</a>, <a href="/moves/stickyweb" data-target="push">Sticky Web</a>, and <a href="/moves/toxicspikes" data-target="push">Toxic Spikes</a>. They are set up on the opposing side of the field when used, and can be removed when a Pokemon on that side uses <a href="/moves/defog" data-target="push">Defog</a> or <a href="/moves/rapidspin" data-target="push">Rapid Spin</a>, or is hit by Defog. Toxic Spikes can also be removed when a grounded (?) <a href="/types/poison" data-target="push">Poison</a>-type Pokemon switches in on the affected side.</p>

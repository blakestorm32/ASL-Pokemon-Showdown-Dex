		<ul>
		<li>Any Pok&eacute;mon healed by a foe’s <a href="/moves/healpulse" data-target="push">Heal Pulse</a> or <a href="/moves/floralhealing" data-target="push">Floral Healing</a> becomes stale.</li>
		<li>Any Pok&eacute;mon affected by a foe’s <a href="/moves/entrainment" data-target="push">Entrainment</a> or <a href="/moves/skillswap" data-target="push">Skill Swap</a> becomes stale.</li>
		<li>Any Pok&eacute;mon <em>using</em> (consuming) an <em>acquired restorative berry</em> (defined as a PP-restoring berry like <a href="/items/leppaberry" data-target="push">Leppa Berry</a> or an HP-restoring berry such as <a href="/items/sitrusberry" data-target="push">Sitrus Berry</a> that the Pokemon did not start the battle with; for example, one obtained via <a href="/moves/fling" data-target="push">Fling</a>, <a href="/moves/trick" data-target="push">Trick</a>, <a href="/abilities/harvest" data-target="push">Harvest</a>, <a href="/moves/recycle" data-target="push">Recycle</a>, <a href="/moves/bugbite" data-target="push">Bug Bite</a>, <a href="/moves/pluck" data-target="push">Pluck</a>, <a href="/abilities/pickup" data-target="push">Pickup</a>, etc.) becomes stale.</li>
		<li>If at any point after the first 100 turns of battle all Pok&eacute;mon on the field are stale, at least one team does not have the option of switching to a non-stale Pok&eacute;mon, and at least one side's Pok&eacute;mon's staleness has been inflicted by a Pok&eacute;mon of the opposing side, the game ends. If only one side started the battle with the <em>rudimentary means to perform restorative berry-cycling</em> (defined to be a team containing a Pok&eacute;mon holding a restorative berry as defined above and a Pok&eacute;mon with <a href="/moves/recycle" data-target="push">Recycle</a>, <a href="/abilities/harvest" data-target="push">Harvest</a>, or <a href="/abilities/pickup" data-target="push">Pickup</a>), it loses. Otherwise, the battle ends in a tie.</li>
		<li>The maximum length of any battle is 1000 turns, after which the game ends in a tie.</li>

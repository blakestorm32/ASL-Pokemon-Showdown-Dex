<h1 id="criticalhit">Critical hit</h1>
		<p>All damaging moves with damage calculated through base power have a chance to critical hit, which multiplies the damage dealt by 1.5. If the move's user has the <a href="/abilities/sniper" data-target="push">Sniper</a> Ability, damage from a critical hit is again multiplied by 1.5. Additionally, if the user's attacking stat stage is less than 0, it will be treated as 0; the same is true if the target's defensive stat stage is greater than 0. If the target has Reflect, Light Screen, or Aurora Veil active, those effects are ignored.</p>
		<p>Most moves start at a critical hit ratio of +0, although high critical hit ratio moves (like <a href="/moves/stoneedge" data-target="push">Stone Edge</a>) start at +1, <a href="/moves/10000000voltthunderbolt" data-target="push">10,000,000 Volt Thunderbolt</a> starts at +2, and <a href="/moves/frostbreath" data-target="push">Frost Breath</a> and <a href="/moves/stormthrow" data-target="push">Storm Throw</a> always result in a critical hit.</p>

		<p>The attacking stat stage and defensive stat stage were considered as a collective unit, and either both treated as 0 or both left as their full value, depending on whether their sum was less than 0. </p>
		<p>High-critical-rate moves were given a starting ratio of +2 rather than +1.</p>
		</dd><dt>Gen 1:</dt><dd>
		<p>The critical modifier of 2x was applied onto the level, as opposed to the final damage. As such, at level 100 it effectively became a multiplier of 82/42x, or about 1.95x. </p>
		<p>Critical hits always caused all stat stages on both sides to be treated as 0, regardless of whether that was slated to result in more or less damage.</p>
		<p>Critical rate was calculated by default as the attacker's base speed divided by 512.</p>
		<p>For high-critical-rate moves such as <a href="/moves/slash" data-target="push">Slash</a> or <a href="/moves/razorleaf" data-target="push">Razor Leaf</a>, the rate instead uses base speed divided by 64, with a maximum of 255/256.</p>
		<p>Focus Energy did not function properly at all, and after using it, the critical rate on all subsequent moves until switch-out was divided by 4.</p>

<h1 id="grounded">Grounded</h1>
		<p>A grounded Pokemon is one that is not under any effect that makes it airborne. A Pokemon is airborne if they are part <a href="/types/flying" data-target="push">Flying type</a>, have the Ability <a href="/abilities/levitate" data-target="push">Levitate</a>, are holding an <a href="/items/airballoon" data-target="push">Air Balloon</a>, or are under the effect of <a href="/moves/magnetrise" data-target="push">Magnet Rise</a> or <a href="/moves/telekinesis" data-target="push">Telekinesis</a>.</p>
		<p>Being airborne grants a Pokemon immunity to several effects. <a href="/types/ground" data-target="push">Ground</a>-type attacking moves (other than <a href="/moves/thousandarrows" data-target="push">Thousand Arrows</a>), the Ability <a href="/abilities/arenatrap" data-target="push">Arena Trap</a>, Terrain (?) effects, <a href="/moves/rototiller" data-target="push">Rototiller</a>, and the hazards (?) set by <a href="/moves/spikes" data-target="push">Spikes</a>, <a href="/moves/stickyweb" data-target="push">Sticky Web</a>, and <a href="/moves/toxicspikes" data-target="push">Toxic Spikes</a> all have no effect on airborne Pokemon.</p>
		<p>Several effects also cause a Pokemon to become grounded, which negates any airborne effect the Pokemon may have had. A Pokemon is grounded if they are under the effect of <a href="/moves/ingrain" data-target="push">Ingrain</a>, <a href="/moves/smackdown" data-target="push">Smack Down</a>, or <a href="/moves/thousandarrows" data-target="push">Thousand Arrows</a>, are holding an <a href="/items/ironball" data-target="push">Iron Ball</a>, or <a href="/moves/gravity" data-target="push">Gravity</a> is in effect.</p>
